    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to setup automated metrics that help you measure, monitor, and understand the behavior of your Watson Assistant system. As described in <a href=\"https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-improve-recommendations-notebook/raw/master/notebook/IBM%20Watson%20Assistant%20Continuous%20Improvement%20Best%20Practices.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Watson Assistant Continuous Improvement Best Practices</a>, this is the first step of your continuous improvement process. The goal of this step is to understand where your assistant is doing well vs where it isn’t and to potentially focus your improvement effort to one of the problem areas identified. We define two measures to achieve this goal: **Coverage** and **Effectiveness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coverage** is the portion of total user messages your assistant is attempting to respond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effectiveness** refers to how well your assistant is handling the conversations it is attempting to respond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-requisite for running this notebook is Watson Assistant (formerly Watson Conversation). This notebook assumes familiarity with Watson Assistant and concepts such as workspaces, intents and training examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming language and environment\n",
    "Some familiarity with Python is recommended. This notebook runs on Python 3.5+ environment.\n"

    "When users engage in a conversation session, an assistant identifies the intent of each message from the user. Based on the logic flow defined in a dialog tree, the assistant communicates with users and performs actions. The assistant may succeed or fail to satisfy users' intent.  One way to identify patterns of success or failure is by analyzing which intents most often lead to a dialog node associated with resolution, and which intents most often lead to users abandoning the session.  Analyzing resolved and abandoned intents can help you identify issues in your assistant to improve, such as a problematic dialog flow or imprecise intents. In this section, we demonstrate a method of conducting intent analysis using context variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce two context variables: `response_context_IntentStarted` and `response_context_IntentCompleted`.  You will need to modify your dialog skill definition (workspace) to introduce these variables in your dialog flow.  After you modify your dialog skill definition, your logs will be marked such that when users trigger a conversation with an intent, the assistant will use `response_context_IntentStarted` to record the intent. During the conversation, the assistant will use `response_context_IntentCompleted` to record if the intent is satisfied. Follow the steps below to add the context variables for an intent in your dialog skill definition.\n",

    "1. Open Dialog Overview page, see <a href=\"https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Dialog Overview</a> for more information.\n",
