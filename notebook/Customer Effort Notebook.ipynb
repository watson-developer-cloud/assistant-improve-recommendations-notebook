    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "_Disambiguation_ and _Autolearning_ features allow your assistant to learn from interactions and improve the user experience over time with minimal human effort. This notebook demonstrates how to measure and analyze the performance improvement after enabling these two features. We use **Customer Effort** as the evaluation metric which quantifies how much effort users must make in order to achieve their intents. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: this notebook requires skills with both _Disambiguation_ and _Autolearning_ features enabled. For more information, see [Disambiguation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-runtime#dialog-runtime-disambiguation) and [Autolearning](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-autolearn).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming language and environment\n",
    "Some familiarity with Python is recommended. This notebook runs on Python 3.5+ environment."
